🦖 Chrome Dino Game : JavaScript Remake

A fun remake of the legendary Google Chrome Dino Game, built entirely using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, developed by me as a learning + gaming project.

🎮 About the Project

This project recreates the classic offline Dino Game that appears in Google Chrome when there's no internet.
The goal: jump over obstacles and survive as long as possible to achieve a high score.
